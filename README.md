Readme file.
First, a screenshot of the PUI2015 directory I created in Ubuntu. I created the environment variable PUI2015 and the alias pui2015, so using cd PUI2015 takes me to the directory, but the alias does the cd operation for me so I only neet to type it and it is all set.


The following screenshots show how I declared the env variable and the alias in my bashrc.
